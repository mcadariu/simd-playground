[Daniel Lemire's](https://lemire.me/blog/) and [Wojciech Mu≈Ça's](http://0x80.pl/) blogs are great resources full of common problems and (very) efficient solutions (most often SIMD-based) encountered in the data processing domain. 
As I was reading the posts, I have observed recurring solutions, potentially you can even call them _patterns_. The goal is to reproduce them on my laptop and gather them in this repo.
