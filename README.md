Daniel Lemire's [blog](https://lemire.me/blog/) and others, like [Wojciech Mu≈Ça's](http://0x80.pl/) are great resources full of common problems and (very) efficient solutions (most often SIMD-based) encountered in the data processing domain. 
As I was reading the posts, I have observed reocurring solutions. In this repo I gather them, as well as: 

* converting one instance of the solutions to Rust
* annotating with visualisations for easier understanding
* run the benchmark to obtain throughput numbers on my laptop
