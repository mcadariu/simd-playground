Daniel Lemire's [blog](https://lemire.me/blog/) is a great resource full of common problems and their (very) efficient solutions (most often SIMD-based) encountered in the data processing field. 
As I am reading the posts, in this repo I'm: 

* converting the solutions to Rust
* annotating it with visualisations for easier understanding
* run the benchmark on my laptop to check speedup
