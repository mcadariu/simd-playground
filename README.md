Daniel Lemire's [blog](https://lemire.me/blog/) is a great resource full of common problems and (very) efficient solutions (most often SIMD-based) encountered in the data processing field. 
As I am reading the posts, I'm also: 

* converting the solutions to Rust
* annotating it with visualisations for easier understanding
* determine throughput numbers obtained on my Apple MacBook Pro laptop
