Daniel Lemire's [blog](https://lemire.me/blog/) is a great resource full of common problems and (very) efficient solutions (most often SIMD-based) encountered in the data processing domain. 
As I am reading the posts, I am distilling reocurring solution patterns and: 

* converting the solutions to Rust
* annotating with visualisations for easier understanding
* run the benchmark to obtain throughput numbers on my laptop
