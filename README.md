Daniel Lemire's [blog](https://lemire.me/blog/) is a treasure trove of common problems and corresponding efficient solutions (SIMD-based) encountered in the data processing domain. 
As I am reading the posts, as active learning: 

* I convert the proposed solution to Rust
* Annotate it with comments containing visualisations for easier understanding
* Compare the results of benchmarking on my laptop with the ones in his posts.
